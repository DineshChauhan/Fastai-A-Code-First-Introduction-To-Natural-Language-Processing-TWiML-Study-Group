       "  xxwrep 18 xxbos xxmaj once again xxmaj mr. xxmaj costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary . xxmaj aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences , of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters . xxmaj most of us have ghosts in the closet , and xxmaj costner 's character are realized early on , and then forgotten until much later , by which time i did not care . xxmaj the character we should really care about is a very cocky , overconfident xxmaj ashton xxmaj kutcher . xxmaj the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he 's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet . xxmaj his only obstacle appears to be winning over xxmaj costner . xxmaj finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker , xxmaj costner tells us all about xxmaj kutcher 's ghosts . xxmaj we are told why xxmaj kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing . xxmaj no magic here , it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in .,  xxwrep 18 xxbos xxmaj this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . xxmaj generic and boring , there 's really nothing worth watching here . a complete waste of the then barely - tapped talents of xxmaj ice - t and xxmaj ice xxmaj cube , who 've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting , and acting well . xxmaj do n't bother with this one , go see xxmaj new xxmaj jack xxmaj city , xxmaj ricochet or watch xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj undercover for xxmaj ice - t , or xxmaj boyz n the xxmaj hood , xxmaj higher xxmaj learning or xxmaj friday for xxmaj ice xxmaj cube and see the real deal . xxmaj ice - t 's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth , and i 'm still wondering what the heck xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton was doing in this film ? xxmaj and why the heck does he always play the exact same character ? xxmaj from xxmaj aliens onward , every film i 've seen with xxmaj bill xxmaj paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character , and at least in xxmaj aliens his character died , which made it somewhat gratifying ... \n",

       "  xxmaj overall , this is second - rate action trash . xxmaj there are countless better films to see , and if you really want to see this one , watch xxmaj judgement xxmaj night , which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script . xxmaj the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing , which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite . 4 / 10 .,  xxwrep 18 xxbos xxmaj first of all i hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads . xxmaj all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like xxunk version of gangsters . \n",

       "  xxmaj my acting in 8th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film ( xxmaj lorenzo xxmaj lamas , xxmaj stephen xxmaj bauer ) . xxmaj line delivery is very fake , and the words themselves are poorly scripted . xxmaj the opening words come from a man checking out his gun 's scope : \" xxmaj boom . xxmaj dead bad guys . \" xxmaj yes , that 's pure genius at work . xxmaj the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories . xxmaj but it , too , seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time . xxmaj we did n't need to know anything about their histories , so why bore us with it ? xxmaj and if you think the conversations are bad , you ai n't seen nothing yet . \n",
